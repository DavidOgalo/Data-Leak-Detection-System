# Data Leak Detection & Prevention System

## Overview

The **Data Leak Detection & Prevention System** is a security-focused application designed to analyze and monitor sensitive data to detect potential leaks, anomalies, and high-risk individuals. This prototype project utilizes advanced search algorithms, pattern recognition, and anomaly detection to process structured data inputs, such as passenger information and travel records, and provide real-time alerts and actionable insights.

This project serves as a foundation for a scalable solution that can be extended to incorporate more complex features like Big Data processing, AI integration, and comprehensive security measures.

## Features

- **Data Leak Detection:** Identifies and prevents unauthorized data access or potential leaks.
- **High-Risk Individual Identification:** Cross-references data against predefined risk profiles to flag potential threats.
- **Anomaly Detection:** Detects abnormal patterns and behaviors within data sets to identify illicit activities.
- **Real-Time Alerts:** Provides actionable insights through instant notifications for suspicious activities.
- **Advanced Search Capabilities:** Utilizes optimized search algorithms for fast and accurate data retrieval.

## Technology Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Core Library:** Custom search and pattern recognition algorithms
- **Security:** Secure data handling and monitoring mechanisms
- **Data Sources:** Structured data inputs (e.g., passenger information, travel records)
- **Deployment:** Local server setup for prototype testing

## Project Goals

1. **Data Leak Detection & Prevention:** Enhance security by monitoring and analyzing sensitive data.
2. **Risk Assessment:** Identify high-risk individuals and make informed decisions on entry or denial.
3. **Anomaly Detection:** Spot irregular activities or patterns in data, aiding in fraud prevention and security enforcement.
4. **Real-Time Alerts:** Provide real-time feedback and insights on potential threats or suspicious activities.
